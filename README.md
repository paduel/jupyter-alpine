# jupyter-docker

This is a minimal [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/)-based [docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for running the Jupyter notebook server.  It is designed for constrained environments in which the size of the docker image is a major consideration.  The latest version (7.x series) is about 340MB uncompressed, roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the official Jupyter images.  It is hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nbgallery/jupyter-alpine/).

We achieve the small image size by using the Alpine Linux base image, minimizing the number of pre-installed Python packages, and installing other language kernels on the fly.  We currently support about a dozen languages, but only Python 2 and 3 are baked into the image.  The other kernels are built into [Alpine packages (apks)](https://github.com/nbgallery/apks) that get [installed](kernels/installers) on first use.  We also build popular Python data science packages into pre-compiled apks that can be installed using the [ipydeps](https://github.com/nbgallery/ipydeps) [dependencies mechanism](https://github.com/nbgallery/ipydeps#dependencieslink).

## Installation

Remember that docker commands usually need to be run as root or via sudo.

You can pull the image from Docker Hub: 

```
docker pull nbgallery/jupyter-alpine
```

To build the image from source, clone or download the repo.  Then build with something like this:

```
docker build -t nbgallery/jupyter-alpine:<version> <source-directory>
```

## Running the image

You will usually launch a container something like this:

```
docker run --rm -p 443:443 nbgallery/jupyter-alpine
```

The default entrypoint is [jupyter-notebook-secure](util/jupyter-notebook-secure), which will generate a self-signed certificate and then launch the jupyter notebook server under HTTPS with an automatically-generated [authentication token](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html).
